" the problem is that... the monthNames array is 0-indexed, so if i subtract 2 from the month?._id?.month(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) to get the correct month name of the month with which we are comparing... but the problem is that if i subtract 2 from 1, it will give me -1, which is not a valid index for the monthNames array, so i have to add 12 to the result of the subtraction to get the correct index of the monthNames array. so how to i tackel with this problem? and get the currect month name at the place of the comparing moonth"
